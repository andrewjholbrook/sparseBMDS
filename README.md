# Sparse BMDS (sBMDS)

The folder `code` contains many different folder. We describe each one and important `Rscripts` in the following:

`MassiveMDS_mse.R`: calculate MSE and relative error for latent variables and sigma respectively
`MassiveMDS_rawllgrad.R`: give the computational time to evaluate the raw log-likelihood and gradient in the `MassiveMDS` package. The `MassiveMDS` package 
`R_rawllgrad_eval.R`: same as above but uses the `sBMDS_functions.R` script in R
